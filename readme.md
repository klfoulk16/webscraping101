# Intro to Webscraping

Welcome to my self directed crash course in web scraping.

The Plan:
1. Read [Real Python's A Practical Introduction to Web Scraping in Python.](https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/) a follow the exercises.
2. Work through the more in-depth (?) [Real Python Web Scraping With Beautiful Soup and Python Tutorial.](https://realpython.com/courses/web-scraping-beautiful-soup/) and follow exercises.
3. The project. If I feel ready, start on the cheap flight project. If not, find something easier to tackle.

The cheap flight project could be the culmination of my Recurse center experience. I hope to build a web app where users can find flights. Most cheap flight finders don't cover as wide a breadth as I'd like - I want to set multiple potential start cities, multiple potential end cities and thoroughly search all in between methods. I often found cheaper flights by hand than by using 'cheap flight finders.'

Eventually if I can figure it out, I'd like to be able to get alerts for mistake fares.

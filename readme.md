# Webscraping 101

Welcome to my self directed crash course in web scraping.

The Plan:
1. Read [Real Python's A Practical Introduction to Web Scraping in Python.](https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/) a follow the exercises. Find the results in step1.py
2. Work through the more in-depth(?) [Real Python Web Scraping With Beautiful Soup and Python Tutorial.](https://realpython.com/courses/web-scraping-beautiful-soup/) and follow exercises.
3. The project. If I feel ready, start on the cheap flight project. If not, find something easier to tackle.
